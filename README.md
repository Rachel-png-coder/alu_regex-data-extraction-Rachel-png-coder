Regular Expressions.  

This project is part of the Regex Onboarding Hackathon and is aimed at demonstrating the use of Regular Expressions (Regex) to extract specific data types. The project handles various formats including email addresses, URLs, phone numbers, credit card numbers, and more, all through the power of Regex.

Overview

In this project, I have implemented a series of Python scripts that extract important pieces of data from raw text. Whether it's web-scraped content or API responses, the scripts utilize regular expressions to efficiently find and extract the following data types:

Email Addresses
URLs
Phone Numbers
Credit Card Numbers
Time Formats (12-hour and 24-hour)
HTML Tags
Hashtags
Currency Amounts

How It Works

The process starts by feeding a large string or webpage data into the program. The text is parsed, and each type of information (e.g., emails, phone numbers) is extracted using specialized regular expressions. The extracted data can then be stored, displayed, or processed further.
